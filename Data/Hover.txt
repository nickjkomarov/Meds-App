Composite NNT<-Composite Numbers Needed to Treat: Weighted average of numbers needed to treat to achieve benefits outcomes.
Composite NNH<-Composite Numbers Needed to Harm: Weighted average of numbers needed to treat to achieve harms outcomes.
Clinical Effectiveness Ranking<-Clinical Effectiveness Ranking based on each drug's distance of composite NNT/NNH from the median composite NNT/NNH. Click on 'More Info' for the calculation methodology and examples.
Adjusted Value Score: Adjusted value score is the estimated percentage of full value after discounting the difference in benefitted vs not benefitted ratio calculated using optimum NNT and observed NNT for the drug. Adjusted value score above 100 is assigned as 100 and adjusted value score below 0 is assigned 0.
